We encountered them a year ago at our campus where.. They made quite a lot of friends with the students. They are both extremely friendly Kass is the mother and is a very calm dog, whereas Dannie is a ball of energy.We know Dannie is about a year or so old. And Kass is 3-4 years old. After being on campus it was decided that these dogs were way too kind and nice to be strays. They will be very sweet pets for any lucky person who decides to adopt one or both of them.. They were placed in good care to be vaccinated, dewormed and sterilized, as well as be made % healthy so that they can be adopted into a good home. Now that time has come, to the dismay of those that have taken so good care of them. They will be missed. If you adopt these dogs, then prepare to keep us updated on their well-being for at least a little while so we know they are being looked after. Looking forward to hearing from any interested in adopting these beauties. You may contact me (Paul) for information. But the adoption is handled by Dulani and Vinuri if you are interested to adopt.",e02abc8a3,5,

She has been there for a week and is doing fantastic. Her wounds are healing and drying up and she has been vaccinated. She might have to stay there for another 2 weeks before she can go home. We have decided not to take her back to Botanical Gardens as we have grown very attached to her and do not want her to go back to her old condition. She likes to go hiking with the regulars so it's possible for her to injure herself again - as such she has already lost her new dog collar & licence that somebody got her. Unfortunately, we already have three dogs of which two are rescue dogs also so can't take her in. Therefore, we need to find a loving HOME for her. Goldie is already an adult female - we don't know how old. She has a lovely brown coat with eyes that will melt your heart. She's very very calm and of good temperament. In all the time we've known her, she has never barked and would happily come when called. She also loves dry dog food. We've taken a couple of pictures of her - which is very difficult as she's always chasing imaginary flies - she's so used to keeping flies off her back ! - Can some KIND SOUL out there please make room in your HOME for this lovely dog who will love you unconditionally. The vet bills are fully paid for so all you need is just to take her home. Her spaying fee will be paid for by the rescuers. Please call us if you are interested and we'll introduce you to GOLDIE..

Sadly the vet diagnosed that the injury was too bad to save the leg and amputation was the best option. The newly named ""Nolan"" went through the operation and recovered amazingly well, in fact the vet told us that after such a major operation he was suprised at how well Nolan has recovered and how healthy he is. Nolan is really happy now that the pain has gone and is very lively and acts and behaves as if 3 legs are better than 4! He tries to show that he can do anything a 4 legged dog can do and do it better! He loves his walks and obviously misses human company as he is always asking for strokes and hugs and giving back kisses and licks. He has gone through an awful lot in his life and after going through so much pain and heartache after being injured and abandoned he really deserves a loving and secure home to live in. He would make a great family pet and would fill any home with love and fun and at the same time still be able to keep it and the family safe and secure!

The humans have many other nicknames for me, you will find out when you get the chance to meet me. :) My owner passed away, and his family could not keep me anymore. I used to produce many puppies for my owner, and my nipples are proof of that. The humans who took me in now said they only add on to my character. Yes, the nipples are a reminder of my past, but who doesn’t have a past right? The humans tell me I never need to produce puppies anymore. Phew, what a relief! Who can resist me, anyway? Just look at my face! Everyone I’ve met only has compliments for me. They always tell me I am the prettiest thing. I love belly rubs! Sometimes I give myself belly rubs by doing a belly dance. The humans said I am the cutest belly dancer. I also love attention and to be near humans. I love my food, of course! Although the humans said I do not have any problem with my skin, I still get the appropriate food as you just never know as we pugs can easily have skin issues. I love my fellow pugs in this house and also the bigger dogs. I’ve never had a problem learning where to do my business.

Details of their rescue can be found here: Snoopy is a 2-month-old female pup. We named her Snoopy because she bears a resemblance to the popular cartoon character. Snoopy is currently under quarantine at the vet to ensure she has not contracted any diseases while at the pound. She will also be dewormed, deflea-ed, deticked, and vaccinated before she goes to her new home. If you are looking for a young pup to be an addition to your family, Snoopy is the perfect candidate! The only conditions that I request are: 1. To spay her when she is old enough (approx. 6 months old) so that she doesn't contribute to the stray overpopulation. Here are the benefits of spaying/neutering your pet: 2. To keep her within your house compound and not to let her roam, where she would be in danger of getting hit by vehicles, or risk getting lost or abused by other people. 3. Not to keep her chained up or locked up in a cage majority of the time because this is no life for a dog, or for any living being for that matter. 4.

Next up is getting them vaccinated and corresponding quarantine period to ensure they're not harbouring any hidden illnesses. They're so far active and healthy, with good appetites. My vet says they are in too good condition to be strays, hence a stronger suspicion that they may have been abandoned. I'm still trying to find them a home where they can be together because they are so attached to each other (we suspect they're siblings), although I am not closed to the idea of getting them adopted separately if really need be. Please do consider adopting them together and give them a second chance at having a family. Adoption conditions: 1. Love them and respect them as you would treat any other person (treat them like how you would like to be treated), provide them access to clean water, healthy food, medical treatments and most of all, give them love and attention. 2. A meet-up between potential adopter and the dogs would be recommended so both can meet each other and see if there's chemistry. 3. Allow occasional visitations so I may see how the adopter and dogs are doing. This will only be once in a while as I respect your privacy. An adoption fee would apply to cover some of their medical expenses. ~Original Post~ I very recently spotted Fred and Ginger near my parents' place. They were not there before, so they must have only just been dumped. Why I suspect that they're dumped pets? They display the following characteristics: 1. They have been in the same spot, out in the open, looking like they're waiting for their owner to return for them. Based on my observation of typical strays, they don't like to be out in the open and prefer to hide, coming out only when they need to look for food. 2. They are friendly; they came right up to me when I got down from my car. Again, looking like they were expecting their owner to come pick them up and take them home. They let me pet them and did not shy away from me at all. Typical strays would just run away when I even step out of my car and will only touch the food after I have driven off. The area where they are at is not safe for them because the people there may call the local council to catch them anytime because they are not stray-friendly at all. And given that Fred and Ginger stay out in the open, they make their presence known because people can see them whenever they pass by. I don't know how old they are, I am just guesstimating that they're around 1-2 years old. Please note that they are NOT purebred German Shepherds but they look like they have some mix of GS in them. They are medium sized, with somewhat short legs (reminds me of basset hounds). Put these features together and you get awesomely cute mixed breeds! I am willing to get them neutered, spayed and vaccinated before they go to their new homes. That is what the adoption fee will go towards. Please find it in your heart to give them a second chance at a home. They've already been dumped once (I suspect); please give them a second chance. If possible, do adopt them together because they are such a lovely couple! (see photo) They don't have much time; I would like to get them off the streets as soon as possible before the people call the local council on them. But I can't do it without securing a home for them first because I cannot afford long-term boarding for them. Please contact me at if you're interested. Genuine adopters only. Thank you.

I responded to the person who posted up a plea for help to relocate them. They are now boarding at my vet's clinic. Heidi will continue nursing her pups for about 2 more weeks then we'll wean them and they'll be ready to go to their forever homes. I am looking for homes for Heidi and her 8 pups. There are 7 males (5 white/cream, 2 brown) and 1 female (brown). About Heidi: She's a great dog. Very calm, gentle and friendly for a stray. Because of her temperament, I'm inclined to think that she's a lost or abandoned dog but I'll never know for sure. But when we were rescuing her and her pups, she never once growled or bared her teeth at us, and I was even able to carry her into my car with no issues, except that she was a bit heavy! Heidi is already dewormed and deflead, and I will get her vaccinated and spayed before she is adopted. On her 8 pups (currently around 1 month old): They are dewormed and deflead. If I manage to secure them homes before they are 2 months old, the adopter will need to take care of their vaccination and MUST agree to spay/neuter them when they are of age (5-6 months). This is of utmost importance in order to prevent unwanted litters. Serious adopters only, and must agree to the simple conditions above. I can send the pups to their adopters within the Klang Valley. Regarding the adoption fee, I am paying for all their boarding and medical expenses from my own personal funds. As such, I would greatly welcome contribution of ANY amount from their adopters to cover some of their fees. This is a long haul case which will require significant funds and any contribution I can get would be most appreciated. Please share to help them find their forever homes! Adopt, don't shop.

Adoption conditions: 1. To neuter him when he is of age (between 6-9 months). This is VERY IMPORTANT as it will prevent stray overpopulation and reduce the number of homeless animals. It is also beneficial to the animal, refer to this link: Please note that there will be a RM deposit required upon adoption, which will be fully refunded upon proof of receipt of neutering. This condition is included due to past bad experience with adopters NOT responding to reminders to neuter the adopted pet. 2. Keep him within your home compound (i.e. not roaming) but not chained up. This is to prevent him getting lost, getting hit by vehicles, abused by people, or attacked by other animals. 3. To keep his vaccinations updated, and provide medical attention when necessary.

I found 1 of her leg is not in normal condition but don't know how it got injured, however doesn't affect her daily routines. In fact she can really run, jump and is a good cather too. She can be quite manja and adorable sometimes yet i kept her outside of the house because of her size and she's very active, can't be left alone when i go work.

It breaks my heart that they are always there since they dont have any owner, no love experienced by human touch, no one to play with them, no guaranteed food. I know they are not the youngest nor the cutest hence why no one wants them but their hearts are just as pure and loving as the young puppies. All im asking is for someome to give them a good home as i believe all dogs deserve a chance regardless of age. I truly hope someone will give these innocent unfortunate souls a chance, they were born strays but they absolutely do not deserve to be living in such an absurd and filthy environment",3715b8520,5,

I brought her to the vet and was informed that she's only about 8 to 9 weeks then. She was really bloated as well with a little flu, so the vet prescribed her with some antibiotics and gave DMG as well as some vits. She just received her first jab last month after full recovery. Sookie knows how to pee and poo on newspaper, but not consistent enough (that's because she's lacking training, which is entirely my fault). She has separation anxiety; would jump on me when i return from work but it has been toned down a lot. She loves to sleep in the same room as me and loves a good run. She loves chewbones and ball; understand ""sit"" and ""no"" and ""down"". She's a smart pup; with patience and time, she could be quite easy to train.

Here are some conditions (to ensure that she finds a good home):- 1) Someone at home to care for her at all times. She must't be left alone for too long. 2) Someone who lives in a terrace (preferably) or willing to bring her to a garden. She loves a good run. 3) Ensure that she is spay and does not breed. 4) Would not mind if I keep in touch with the new owner for Sookie's update.

So this 'young' ciku is looking for love again. He deserves a good home after all he has been through. _______________________________________________ This old boy was abandoned in SPCA. Most likely due to his age. Thorough blood test (including heartworm) were done by private vet. He's certified healthy & in fact he doesn't look like 10 (must be the botox ;-)) The only tell tale sign is he has a few teeth left. He has been given an annual jab for heartworm and I'll get him vaccinated & neutered as well. What I know about this fella - * excellent temperament * good with kids especially young ones * still playful * has a 'territory marking' problem (can be fixed with lotsa of love and patience) * not toilet trained (again can be taught through consistent routine) I am hoping that someone with a big heart can take him in and let him feel loved again. It's not easy for an old dog to get a second chance. In fact his chance would have run out if I didn't take him out of SPCA & foster him. That special someone ideally should have some experience with dogs bcoz points 4 & 5. Most importantly he/she should stick with / by him through thick & thin.

He loves going for walks or a run if you’re looking for a jogging companion. He loves being around people so he’s a great dog to keep as company. He is very communicative and will tell you if he needs to go to the bathroom, if he’s hungry or if somebody is outside the house. He is very wary of strange motorbikes and is very alert to even the smallest noise, so he makes a very good watch dog. He is a dog with many funny traits and will be there to love and brighten even your dullest day. All he needs is a new owner that is happy to shower him with abundance of love and promises to feed him his favourite food, he will be your best friend forever.

Advisable to first put him on leash before opening the door as he runs very fast and will be very hard to catch if he runs!",e316eb837,4,

I am looking for people to adopt these 2 female dogs, Jane (black and brown) and Julia (white with black specks). They are currently approximately 3-4 months old. The sisters were adopted 2 months ago. I found them in a box at the market. Death was knocking on Julia's door due to a viral infection but I sent her to the vet for a few days and nursed her back to health, and now she is the more active of the pair. Both Jane and Julia are very smart puppies, learning to recognise their own names merely just after 1 week! They are loving and friendly dogs, and like to lick their owners when they are out from their cage. They are potty trained to pee and poop on newspapers (so don't leave any new newspapers/magazines lying around!). Also, they understand simple commands like ""come in"", ""go out"", ""NO!"" (as long as you teach them where is ""in"" and ""out""). Julia is a very smart and curious dog, likes exploring the surrounding and trying out new stuffs. On the other hand, Jane is the contrast of Julia. Keeping more to herself, she is very obedient and more gentle, a huge contrast to her sibling. Though the two dogs are opposites of each other, they love each other, and more importantly their owners very much. I am looking for people who would like to adopt them as I already have 2 dogs in my place and we don't have the time and resources to take care of them. Though they may be mixed breed, they are good and loyal dogs and I hope that you would kindly take them in as a family. I can be contacted at (Madam Lee).

The owner of the puppy disowned a litter of puppies because they couldn't afford them though the puppy comes from a wealthy family which I think its mother comes from a good breed. My dog is around 3 months old right now, still growing and I need to find him a new owner ASAP. This is because the puppy had began to lose some fur and it now has a minor skin infection, but my father wouldn't take it to the veterinary because he thinks that this is a waste of money.If you were to ask me, my pup has got a beautiful sets of teeth and paws, he's actually cute cute himself. The puppy itself is actually very cute and quite energetic for people out there who loves to be around outdoor. The reason for me to post this ad is because I'm a uni student currently having my sem break and I'm afraid that my Dad might abandon the dog somewhere near the factories or worse at the construction company that he is working in. The environment near the construction itself is worse, and the Vietnamese and Myanmar foreign workers have been known to slaughter stray dogs including those around the construction sites for protein as they couldn't afford any meat. Puppies like these will be killed for their meats. I have no doubts of this. I'm seriously hoping to look for a new owner for this pup before my new semester kick starts. To be honest I don't think that my puppy's skin infection is serious, as I believe it can be dealt with if the puppy have medical attention. The puppy itself is not aggressive and he's a bit shy but once you get to know him, you'll love him. Please, someone, adopt this poor dog before it ends up on someone's plate. Call me or text me at- for more information. I am giving away this pet, not selling it. As long as the new owner loves this dog, and would be able to take good care of it, I'm happy.",8f2b809a0,1,

Unfortunately, he goes slightly wild when he sees a cat or a female dog. He has not been spayed because I never believed in removing the manhood of an animal for our own comfort.
