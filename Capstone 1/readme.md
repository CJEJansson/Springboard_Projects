# **A Home for All**

A local animal shelter has requested that a methodology be developed to help them more strategically process animals and ultimately improve adoption outcomes for their current residents. By leveraging the Kaggle Petfinder data and analyzing the trends between dog’s features and adoption outcome, a set of models were developed. These models can be used by the client to develop a specific strategy for each type of dog and ensure the funds needed to support an animal finding a home are best leveraged. These models revealed that it’s easy to predict which animals are adopted in under 90 days. Those animals that take longer to adopt can be sent to intensive training, or resituated with a better positioned rescue to ensure their placement in the correct “Fur-ever” Home.

## Getting Started

Viewing this project will require an installation of Juypyter Notebook or use of the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) website. Running the code provided in this project will require Python v.3.7.1 and those libraries listed at the top of each notebook.

## The Data Set



### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
