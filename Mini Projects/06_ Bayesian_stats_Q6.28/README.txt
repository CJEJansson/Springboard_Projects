Learning Objectives:
	1. Learn to propose a probabilistic model for data.
  2. Learn to specify suitable prior distributions for parameters.
  3. Learn to encode the complete model within a PyMC3 context.
  4. Learn to generate posterior distributions for the model parameters.
  5. Learn to scrutinize diagnostic plots to evaluate a PyMC3 model.
  6. Learn how to apply a probabilistic modeling approach to a real problem.

Assignment:
  For this final mini-project, you’ll return to the hospital dataset you’ve
  worked with in the previous subunits to practice applying what you’ve
  learned about Bayesian inference. As with the last mini-projects, we’ve
  included some additional tips and information to help you better understand
  this approach to inference.
