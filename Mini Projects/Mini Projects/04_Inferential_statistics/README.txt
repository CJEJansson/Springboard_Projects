Assignment: 
    Frequentist Inference 1A. 
                Think of this assignment as both a demonstration and mini-project — you’ll be introduced to concepts like t- and                 z-tests, how to calculate standard deviation from a sample, and the Central Limit Theorem, and get some hands-on                 practice working with these concepts using simulated normal data. Complete your work in your own notebook and                   submit it to your GitHub account. 

    Frequentist Inference 1B. 
        This mini-project was designed to give you additional practice using frequentist inference with real-world data from a           hospital. You’ll use this same hospital dataset while working on the other two mini-projects in this unit. Complete your         work in your own notebook and submit it to your GitHub account.
