Learning Objectives: 
	1. Learn to calculate a confidence interval using the bootstrap 
           method.
	2. Learn to calculate a p-value using the bootstrap.
	3. Learn to perform hypothesis tests using the bootstrap.
	4. Learn to apply the bootstrap to perform tests where the 
	   frequentist method does not apply.

Assignment: 
	In this mini-project, you'll use the same medical charge data you used 
	in the frequentist inference mini-project, but this time you'll make
	inferences about the population using bootstrapping (ie. simulating 
	repeated re-runs of an experiment.) If frequentism is about using 
	assumptions and theoretical results to calculate what we expect to 
	happen were an experiment to be run again and again and again, then 
	bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the 
	sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens.
