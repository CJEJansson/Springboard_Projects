## <span>Capstone 1: A Home for All<span> <a name ="AHomeforAll"></a>
A local animal shelter has requested that a methodology be developed to help them more strategically process animals and ultimately improve adoption outcomes for their current residents. By leveraging the Kaggle Petfinder data and analyzing the trends between dog’s features and adoption outcome, a set of models were developed. These models can be used by the client to develop a specific strategy for each type of dog and ensure the funds needed to support an animal finding a home are best leveraged. These models revealed that it’s easy to predict which animals are adopted in under 90 days. Those animals that take longer to adopt can be sent to intensive training, or resituated with a better positioned rescue to ensure their placement in the correct “Fur-ever” Home.

This project has been broken into four sections, and the code for each section can be found at the following:
1. **[Data Wrangling:](https://github.com/CJEJansson/A-Home-for-All/blob/main/1.%20Data_Wrangling/Data_Wrangling.ipynb)** Downloading data, extracting features, creating features, data clean up
2. **[Data Storytelling:](https://github.com/CJEJansson/A-Home-for-All/blob/main/2.%20Data_Storytelling/Data_Storytelling.ipynb)** Analyzing graphically and statistically the impact of each feature on Adoption Speed.
3. **[Statistical Data Analysis:](https://github.com/CJEJansson/A-Home-for-All/blob/main/3.%20Statistical_Data_Analysis/Statistical_Data_Analysis.ipynb)** Analysing the statistical correlation between features of the dataset and Adoption Speed.
4. **[In Depth Analysis:](https://github.com/CJEJansson/A-Home-for-All/blob/main/4.%20In-Depth%20Analysis/In_Depth_Analysis.ipynb)** Application of machine learning techniques to predict adoption speed.

## <span>Capstone 2: Predicting Cardiovascular Heart Disease<span> <a name ="PredictingCHD"></a>
Cardiovascular heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death annually worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases can, however, be managed if caught early and simple lifestyle changes are made. This project explores a set of data for patients measuring known factors for heart disease to develop a machine learning model to predict risk of developing heart disease within the next ten years.

The project has been broken into two sections, and the code for each section can be found at the following:
1. **[Data Wrangling, Storytelling, and Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/CJEJansson/Springboard_Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20Cardivascular%20Heart%20Disease/Predicting%20CHD%20-%20In-Depth%20Analysis.ipynb)** Downloading data, extracting features, creating features, data clean up. Analyzing graphically and statistically the impact of each feature on the risk of developing CHD in the next 10 years. Analysing the statistical correlation between features of the dataset and the risk of developing CHD in the next 10 years.
2. **[In-Depth Analysis](https://github.com/CJEJansson/Springboard_Projects/blob/master/Predicting%20Cardivascular%20Heart%20Disease/Predicting%20Cardiovascular%20Disease.ipynb)** Application of machine learning techniques to predict adoption speed.
