    "# Predicting Cardiovascular Disease \n",

    "### Project Overview: \n",

    "**The Problem**\n",
    "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death annually worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases can, however, be managed if caught early and simple lifestyle changes are made. This project would explore a set of data for patients measuring known factors for heart disease to develop a machine learning model to predict risk of developing heart disease within the next ten years. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Client:**\n",
    "A small clinic in Framingham, Massachusetts has seen a decided spike in cases of cardiovascular disease in their patients. Rather than sit back and wait for illness to strike, the lead cardiologist has decided to be proactive. They’ve reached out to us to review their clinical data and develop a model to predict their patient’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years. The physician has two goals in mind: help identify those at risk and start acting before things get worse, and determine which patients are statistically more likely to develop problems and provide them with educational material before things become a problem. The model developed from their patient dataset will be used to do exactly that. A statistical model will be used to develop a patient education program, targeted at specific potential risk patients, and to help bring awareness surrounding cardiovascular disease before it becomes a problem. A machine learning model will also be used to target identified “at risk” patients and help them combat more severe cardiovascular disease by targeting treatment and making recommended life-style changes for those patients who are identified as being at risk.\n"
